//! BLAS bindings and wrappers.
//!
//! Bindings are split by BLAS level and contained in a module named `ll`
//! (stands for low level, not sure if that's the best name, but that's
//! what it is).
//!
//! Wrappers are split likewise. They are named after the function they wrap,
//! but capitalized and contained in their respective `ops` modules. To use
//! these wrappers, the appropriate traits must be implemented for the type.
//! These are either `Vector` or `Matrix`.
//!
//! * Level 1: `vector`
//! * Level 2: `matrix_vector`
//! * Level 3: `matrix`
