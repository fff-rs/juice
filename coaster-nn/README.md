coaster-NN provides Neural Network related algorithms for [coaster][coaster].
Run NN operations on servers, desktops or mobiles, GPUs, FPGAs or CPUS, without
carrying about OpenCL or CUDA support on the machine.

It powers [Juice][juice].

For more information,

* see coaster-NN's [Documentation](http://spearow.github.io/coaster-nn)
* visit [coaster][coaster] for more information about portable operations and other Plugins.
* or get in touch on [Gitter][chat]

## Provided Operations

This Plugins provides the following operations to the coaster Backend.
Every Operation includes forward + backward. A `-` means not yet implemented.
More information can be found in the [Documentation][docs-ops].

Kudos to [ehiggs][ehiggs], for implementing the initial native Rust operations.

## Getting Started

If you're using Cargo, just add coaster-NN to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    coaster = "0.1.0"
    coaster-nn = "0.4.0"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can call:

    $ cargo add coaster-nn

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

## Usage

Bring the Plugin trait and the other important coaster traits/structs in scope and
you will be able to execute the here provided operations on your coaster Backend.

```rust
extern crate coaster as co;
extern crate coaster_nn as nn;
use co::prelude::*;
use nn::*;
fn main() {
    // Initialize a CUDA Backend.
    let backend = Backend::<Cuda>::default().unwrap();
    // Initialize two SharedTensors.
    // Usually you would want also fill them with data.
    // More infos about that in the coaster README.md
    let mut x = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(backend.device(), &(1, 1, 3)).unwrap();
    let mut result = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(backend.device(), &(1, 1, 3)).unwrap();
    // Use the operation provided by this Plugin.
    backend.sigmoid(&mut x, &mut result);
}
```
