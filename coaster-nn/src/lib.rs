//! Provides a [Coaster][coaster] Plugin, to extend Coaster with Neural Network related
//! operations such as convolutions, pooling, ReLU, etc. A full list of operations provided by this Plugin,
//! can be found at the [provided Operations section](#operations).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This Coaster Plugin extends Coaster's Backend with NN related methods/operations. This allows
//! you to run, these operations (and therefore your application) on your local machine as well as on servers,
//! mobiles or any other machine (as if they were written for common CPU execution), while
//! receiving the significant performance increases (usually one-to-two orders of magnitutde), by
//! executing the operations on special purpose hardware such as GPUs - if they are available. Usage examples
//! can be found in the next section.
//!
//! The architecture of a Plugin is quite easy. It defines one Plugin Trait, in this case the `NN`
//! trait, which implements basic functionality for initialization and multiple Plugin Operation Traits which define the
//! methods which are going to be available on the Backed, as the Plugin Trait as well as the Plugin Operations Traits
//! are implemented for the Coaster Backends (CUDA, OpenCL, Native). The operations take as arguments one or many
//! SharedTensors, holding the data over which the operation should happen, and none or one Operation Configuration.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! An example on how to write some data into a SharedTensor and compute the result of the
//! sigmoid function for each value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! extern crate coaster as co;
//! extern crate coaster_nn as nn;
//! # #[cfg(feature = "cuda")]
//! # mod cuda {
//! use co::prelude::*;
//! use co::frameworks::native::flatbox::FlatBox;
//! use nn::*;
//!
//! fn write_to_memory<T: Copy>(mem: &mut FlatBox, data: &[T]) {
//!     let mut mem_buffer = mem.as_mut_slice::<T>();
//!     for (index, datum) in data.iter().enumerate() {
//!         mem_buffer[index] = *datum;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! use crate::co::frameworks::cuda::get_cuda_backend;
//! pub fn main() {
//!     // Initialize a CUDA Backend.
//!     // Usually you would not use CUDA but let Coaster pick what is available on the machine.
//!     let backend = get_cuda_backend();
//!
//!     // Initialize two SharedTensors.
//!     let mut x = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(&(1, 1, 3));
//!     let mut result = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(&(1, 1, 3));
//!     // Fill `x` with some data.
//!     let payload: &[f32] = &::std::iter::repeat(1f32).take(x.capacity()).collect::<Vec<f32>>();
//!     let native = Native::new();
//!     let cpu = native.new_device(native.hardwares()).unwrap();
//!     write_to_memory(x.write_only(&cpu).unwrap(), payload); // Write to native host memory.
//!     // Run the sigmoid operation, provided by the NN Plugin, on your CUDA enabled GPU.
//!     backend.sigmoid(&mut x, &mut result).unwrap();
//!     // See the result.
//!     println!("{:?}", result.read(&cpu).unwrap().as_slice::<f64>());
//! }
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "cuda"))]
//! # mod cuda {
//! # pub fn main() {}
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #     if cfg!(feature = "cuda") {
//! #         cuda::main();
//! #    }
//! # }
//! ```
