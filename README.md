rust-cuDNN provides safe wrapper for [CUDA's cuDNN][cudnn] library, so you can use
it comfortably and safely in your Rust application.

As cuDNN relies on CUDA to allocate memory on the GPU, you might also look into [rust-cuda][rust-cuda].

rust-cudnn was developed at [Autumn][autumn] for the Rust Machine Intelligence Framework [Leaf][leaf].

rust-cudnn is part of the High-Performance Computation Framework [Collenchyma][collenchyma], for the
[Neural Network Plugin][nn]. For an easy, unified interface for NN operations, such as those provided by
cuDNN, you might check out [Collenchyma][collenchyma].

For more information,

## Getting Started

If you're using Cargo, just add rust-cuDNN to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    cudnn = "1.3.1"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can call:

    $ cargo add cudnn

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

## Example

Using the high-level `Cudnn` interface.

```rust
extern crate cudnn;
extern crate libc;
use cudnn::{Cudnn, TensorDescriptor};
use cudnn::utils::{ScalParams, DataType};
fn main() {
    // Initialize a new cuDNN context and allocates resources.
    let cudnn = Cudnn::new().unwrap();
    // Create a cuDNN Tensor Descriptor for `src` and `dest` memory.
    let src_desc = TensorDescriptor::new(&[2, 2, 2], &[4, 2, 1], DataType::Float).unwrap();
    let dest_desc = TensorDescriptor::new(&[2, 2, 2], &[4, 2, 1], DataType::Float).unwrap();
    let acti = cudnn.init_activation().unwrap();
    // Obtain the `src` and memory pointer on the GPU.
    // NOTE: You wouldn't do it like that. You need to really allocate memory on the GPU with e.g. CUDA or Collenchyma.
    let src_data: *const ::libc::c_void = ::std::ptr::null();
    let dest_data: *mut ::libc::c_void = ::std::ptr::null_mut();
    // Now you can compute the forward sigmoid activation on your GPU.
    cudnn.sigmoid_forward::<f32>(&acti, &src_desc, src_data, &dest_desc, dest_data, ScalParams::default());
}
```

## Building

rust-cudnn depends on the cuDNN runtime libraries,
which can be obtained from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).

### Manual Configuration

rust-cudnn's build script will by default attempt to locate `cudnn` via pkg-config.
This will not work in some situations, for example,
* on systems that don't have pkg-config,
* when cross compiling, or
* when cuDNN is not installed in the default system library directory (e.g. `/usr/lib`).

Therefore the build script can be configured by exporting the following environment variables:

* `CUDNN_LIB_DIR`<br/>
If specified, a directory that will be used to find cuDNN runtime libraries.
e.g. `/opt/cuda/lib`

* `CUDNN_STATIC`<br/>
If specified, cuDNN libraries will be statically rather than dynamically linked.

* `CUDNN_LIBS`<br/>
If specified, will be used to find cuDNN libraries under a different name.

If either `CUDNN_LIB_DIR` or `CUDNN_INCLUDE_DIR` are specified, then the build script will skip the pkg-config step.

If your also need to run the compiled binaries yourself, make sure that they are available:
```sh
# Linux; for other platforms consult the instructions that come with cuDNN
cd <cudnn_installpath>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
