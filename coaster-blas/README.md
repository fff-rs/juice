coaster-BLAS provides full BLAS support for [Coaster][coaster],
so you can use Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms on servers, desktops or mobiles,
GPUs, FPGAs or CPUS, without caring about OpenCL or CUDA support on the
machine.

It powers [Juice][juice].

For more information,

* see coaster-BLAS's [Documentation](https://spearow.github.io/coaster-blas)
* visit [Coaster][coaster] for portable operations and other Plugins.
* or get in touch on [Gitter][chat]

Note that `blas` does not have all methods and thus fails to link, use `CARGO_BLAS=openblas` to compile for `native`
